## About me

I'm Martyna and I'm an engineer based in Sydney, NSW, Australia, but originally I come from Poland.

I got my Masters Degree in Chemical and Process Engineering and I have several years of experience in the laboratory environment, mainly research and development departments.

Currently I would like to use my analytical and research skills in programming, so I'm intensively studying different techniques to become an automation tester. 

I'd be happy to gain some hands-on experience in a professional work environment. If you would like to get in touch, please see my resume below.
